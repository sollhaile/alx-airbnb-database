0. Project Initialization
Project Overview
This project is a web application inspired by Airbnb, allowing users to search for, list, book, and review short-term rental properties. It aims to replicate key features of Airbnb, including user authentication, property listings with images, booking management, payments, and reviews.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
Enable users to list their properties for rent.

Allow guests to search for properties by location, price, and availability.

Implement secure booking and payment functionality.

Support user reviews and ratings for properties.

Provide a responsive, user-friendly interface for both hosts and guests.

1. Technology Stack
   
Django: Backend web framework to handle business logic, APIs, and admin panel.

PostgreSQL: Database to store user data, listings, bookings, and reviews.

React: Frontend JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.

GraphQL: API query language to optimize data fetching between frontend and backend.

Redis: In-memory cache to improve performance of frequently accessed data.

Docker: Containerization platform to ensure consistent development and deployment environments.

Nginx: Web server and reverse proxy to serve static content and manage HTTP requests.

Stripe API: Payment gateway for handling secure online transactions.

AWS S3: Cloud storage for hosting and delivering user-uploaded property images.
2. Technology Stack Overview

Django: A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend of the application, handle business logic, and expose RESTful APIs for the frontend.

PostgreSQL: A relational database management system used to store structured data such as user profiles, property listings, bookings, and reviews.

React: A JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces on the client side.

GraphQL: A query language used to allow the frontend to fetch exactly the data it needs from the backend APIs, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

Redis: An in-memory data store used for caching frequently accessed data (e.g., search results, session information) to improve response times.

Docker: A containerization platform used to package the application and its dependencies, enabling consistent development, testing, and production environments.

Nginx: A web server and reverse proxy used to serve static files, handle HTTPS, and forward client requests to the backend application servers.

Stripe API: A payment processing platform integrated into the system to securely handle transactions for bookings.

AWS S3: Amazon Simple Storage Service used to store and serve user-uploaded images such as property photo
3. Database Design
The projectâ€™s database consists of several key entities that represent the core functionality of the Airbnb-like platform:

Entities and Fields
User

id: Unique identifier for the user

name: Full name of the user

email: Userâ€™s email address

password_hash: Hashed password for authentication

role: Defines if the user is a guest or a host

Property

id: Unique identifier for the property

owner_id: References the User who owns the property

title: Name of the property listing

description: Detailed description of the property

price_per_night: Price charged per night

Booking

id: Unique identifier for the booking

property_id: References the booked Property

user_id: References the User who made the booking

start_date: Check-in date

end_date: Check-out date

Review

id: Unique identifier for the review

property_id: References the reviewed Property

user_id: References the User who wrote the review

rating: Numeric rating (1-5 stars)

comment: Text feedback

Payment

id: Unique identifier for the payment

booking_id: References the Booking being paid for

amount: Total amount paid

payment_date: Date when the payment was made

status: Payment status (e.g., completed, pending, failed)

Entity Relationships
A User can own multiple Properties (1-to-many)

A User can make multiple Bookings (1-to-many)

A Property can have multiple Bookings and Reviews (1-to-many)

A Booking must belong to one Property and one User (many-to-1)

A Payment is linked to exactly one Booking (1-to-1)

4. Feature Breakdown
   
User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. Users can sign up as hosts to list properties or as guests to book properties, with secure authentication and role-based access.

Property Management
Enables hosts to create, update, and delete property listings with details such as title, description, price, photos, and availability. This feature gives hosts control over their rental offerings.

Booking System
Lets guests search for available properties, select dates, and make bookings. It handles date validation, prevents overlapping reservations, and tracks booking history for both guests and hosts.

Review System
Allows guests to leave reviews and ratings for properties after completing a stay. Reviews help improve trust and transparency by providing feedback to hosts and future guests.

Payment Integration
Supports secure online payments for bookings through Stripe API. This feature handles payment processing, tracking transactions, and ensuring that bookings are only confirmed after payment is successful.

Search and Filter
Provides a search interface where guests can find properties by location, price range, and availability. This improves the user experience by helping guests quickly find suitable accommodations.
5. API Security
To protect sensitive data and maintain the integrity of the platform, the following key security measures will be implemented:

Authentication
All API endpoints will require user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This ensures that only verified users can access protected resources, helping prevent unauthorized access to user accounts and bookings.

Authorization
Role-based access control will be enforced to restrict actions based on user roles (e.g., guest, host, admin). This prevents users from performing operations they are not permitted to, such as unauthorized property edits or admin-only actions.

Rate Limiting
API rate limiting will be implemented to restrict the number of requests from a single IP within a given timeframe. This protects the application from brute-force attacks, API abuse, and denial-of-service (DoS) attempts.

Input Validation & Sanitization
All incoming API data will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS). This ensures that only clean and expected data is processed by the backend.

HTTPS Enforcement
All API communications will occur over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, protecting sensitive information such as login credentials and payment details from interception.

Why API Security Matters
API security is crucial for protecting user data (personal information, passwords), financial transactions (payments via Stripe), and platform integrity (preventing unauthorized access or manipulation). Without robust security measures, the application would be vulnerable to data breaches, fraud, and system abuse

6. CI/CD Pipeline
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying the application. Each time code is pushed to the repository, the pipeline runs automated tests and builds the project to ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality. Once verified, the application is automatically deployed to staging or production environments.

CI/CD pipelines are essential for maintaining code quality, reducing manual errors, enabling faster releases, and ensuring that deployments are repeatable and reliable.

Tools Used
For this project, the CI/CD pipeline can be implemented using:

GitHub Actions: To automate testing, building, and deployment workflows directly from the GitHub repository.

Docker: To containerize the application and ensure consistent deployments across environments.

AWS (or other cloud providers): For hosting and deploying the production environment.

Heroku (optional): As an alternative platform for simplified deployment during development.
